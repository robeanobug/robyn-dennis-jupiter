      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 27-year-old woman. I have a degree in Biochemistry from NC State
        University. I am learning Javascript, HTML and CSS. I am currently a
        nanny for 2 families. Recently I have been improving myself by learning
        how to cook and make healthy and budget-friendly meals at home. I enjoy
        hanging out with my friends online playing video games. I am also in my
        reading era and have been enjoying romance, fantasy, and thriller
        genres. My favorite foods are burritos, sushi, and bagels, although
        recently I've been enjoying tomato soup with grilled cheese. I know all
        these things shouldn't be included in a portfolio, I'm just info dumping
        to get words on the page.
